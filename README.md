# Computer-Graphics-2nd-Project
This project simulates a Star Wars-inspired 3D scene where two spaceships depart from opposite hangars and move across the scene towards the opposite hangar. The objective is to demonstrate the use of 3D transformations, camera controls, lighting, and object loading in OpenGL.
